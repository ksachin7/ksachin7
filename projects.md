# My Projects

Welcome to my projects repository!
<!-- These projects are not part of any course or tutorial; they are the result of my own exploration and learning journey.My main objective is to learn how things are done in the proper way, how to build a full-stack app from scratch.   -->
Each project here represents a step forward in my quest for deeper understanding of software development.

## 1. Online Shopping Application

<!-- [![Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repository-OnlineShopping-yellow?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/ksachin7/microservices-app)   -->
The Online Shopping System is a microservices-based application designed to handle various aspects of an online shopping platform, including product management, order processing, inventory management, and notifications. The project is built using Spring Boot for backend services and React for the frontend.

### Application Architecture

The system is composed of several microservices, each responsible for a specific domain within the application. These services communicate with each other via REST APIs and are managed and deployed using Docker and Kubernetes.

- **Testing**: Utilize Testcontainers and WireMock for robust backend integration tests, and Jest for comprehensive frontend React unit tests to ensure better coverage and reliability.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Refine the user interface and experience for better usability and design.
- **Redis**: Use redis for cart and inventory for caching and to improve performance.
- **Payment Service**: Create payment service to manage payments.
- **OTP-Service**: Develop an OTP service for password recovery.
- **Spring Profile**: Utilize Spring profiles for configuration management.
