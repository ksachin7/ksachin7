# My Projects

Welcome to my projects repository. These projects are not part of any course or tutorial; they are the result of my own exploration and learning journey.<!-- My main objective is to learn how things are done in the proper way, how to build a full-stack app from scratch.  --> Each project here represents a step forward in my quest for deeper understanding of software development.
